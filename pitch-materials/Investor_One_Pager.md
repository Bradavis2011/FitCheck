# Or This? — Investor One-Pager

---

## Confidence in every choice.

**Or This?** gives women instant, honest outfit feedback at the exact moment they need it — standing in front of the mirror, about to leave the house. Snap a photo. Tell us where you're going. Get editorial-quality AI feedback in 30 seconds. Ask follow-ups like you would with a trusted, stylish friend.

We own the **moment of decision**. Not inspiration. Not shopping. Not social media. The 30 seconds before you walk out the door — that moment, specifically, belongs to us.

---

## The Problem

Outfit indecision is a universal daily friction point. 72% of women report it causes daily stress. The average woman changes outfits 2–3 times before leaving for anything important. And every existing solution fails:

- **Friends** — biased, unavailable, or "you look fine"
- **Social media** — too slow, too public, not actionable
- **Stylists** — $100–500/session, appointment-only, not available at 7:45am on a Tuesday
- **ChatGPT** — no fashion expertise, no occasion context, no voice

There is no honest, instant, private feedback source at the moment of decision. That gap is our entire reason for existing.

## The Solution

A Vogue editor in your pocket. Powered by vision AI.

Our AI evaluates color harmony, proportions, fit, and occasion-appropriateness — then speaks plainly. No hedging. No "it depends." Specific praise, honest critique, and quick fixes you can make before you leave. Then keep asking — "What shoes would work better?" "Is this too casual for a client dinner?" — until you're sure.

Over time, **Style DNA** builds a personalized style profile from every check. Feedback gets sharper. The AI knows your color season, your body type, your fashion goals. It gets better the more you use it.

## Two Markets. One Product.

Or This? sits at the intersection of consumer subscriptions and fashion intelligence data.

| | Size | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| **TAM** | $1.8T | Global apparel market (Grand View Research, 2025) |
| **SAM** | $5.5B → $15B | Online personal styling services, 15% CAGR (FutureDataStats, 2024) |
| **SOM** | $200M Year 5 ARR | 2M paying subscribers × ~$100/yr blended ARPU + B2B data licensing |

**Why now:** Vision AI crossed the quality threshold in 2023–24. For the first time, models can reliably analyze a real outfit photo and give specific, useful, fashion-literate feedback. This category could not have existed 18 months ago. AI API costs have dropped 90% since 2022 and keep falling — our COGS improves automatically, every quarter, without us doing anything.

---

## The Data Layer

Every outfit check generates structured fashion intelligence: StyleDNA attributes, color harmonies, occasion patterns, garment frequencies, AI scores, and community signals. At scale, this becomes something no competitor can replicate without the same user base — **the world's only real-time, bottom-up consumer fashion dataset**.

**Comparable:** WGSN earns ~$100M+ ARR selling fashion intelligence built on runway predictions and trend surveys. Ours is built on what real people actually wear, to real occasions, scored by AI and validated by community consensus. It's a fundamentally better data source.

**B2B revenue products:**

| Product | Price | Buyer |
|---|---|---|
| Trend Reports | $15–50K / quarter | Brands, retailers, forecasters |
| Custom Research | $25–100K per study | Brands with specific questions |
| Real-Time Trend API | $5–20K / month | Fast-fashion retailers |
| White-Label Styling SDK | $10–50K / month | Retailer apps |

At scale, B2B data licensing is the highest-margin revenue stream — and the deepest moat. The consumer app is the data collection engine. The dataset is the asset.

## Business Model

**Layer 1 — Consumer subscriptions:**

**Free** (3 checks/day, ads) → **Plus** ($4.99/mo, unlimited) → **Pro** ($14.99/mo, expert reviews + analytics)

**Layer 2 — Fashion intelligence (B2B):** Trend reports · API access · Custom research · White-label SDK

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Cost per AI check | ~$0.003 |
| Blended monthly cost per user | ~$0.50 |
| Subscription price | $4.99–$14.99/mo |
| Target LTV:CAC | 10–30x |
| Gross margin trend | Improving (AI costs dropping ~50% YoY) |

## Competitive Advantage

Nobody owns the moment of decision. Stitch Fix sends boxes — that's days, not seconds. Pinterest is inspiration, not feedback. ChatGPT is generic, not fashion-literate.

**Our moat compounds:**
- **Style DNA** — personalized profiles that deepen with every check. The app gets smarter about *you* over time.
- **Dataset** — every outfit analyzed adds to a proprietary, real-time fashion intelligence corpus that competitors can't replicate without our user base.
- **AI quality pipeline** — automated self-calibration. When helpfulness drops, the AI corrects. Our quality improves automatically.
- **Network effects** — community feedback, A/B comparisons, and give-to-get mechanics make the product better as it grows.
- **16 AI agents** — one founder can operate this at the scale of a 10-person team.

---

## Growth Strategy

1. **Private beta** — 500 users from Reddit fashion communities (r/femalefashionadvice: 2M+ members) + founder's modeling/acting network
2. **TikTok + ProductHunt** — the 30-second feedback loop is inherently short-form video. Outfit content dominates the platform.
3. **Organic flywheel** — "Or This?" A/B comparisons are designed to be shared. Every outfit check is a potential acquisition moment.

**Built-in virality:** The brand name is a conversation. Every share is a product demo.
