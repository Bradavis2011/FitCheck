# Or This? — Investor One-Pager

---

## AI-powered outfit feedback in 30 seconds.

**Or This?** is the first app that gives women instant, honest, expert-quality outfit feedback at the moment of decision — before they walk out the door. Powered by specialized fashion AI, it replaces the biased friend, the unhelpful partner, and the expensive stylist with a private, always-available, brutally honest style advisor.

---

## The Problem

72% of women report daily outfit indecision. The average woman changes outfits 2-3x before leaving the house. No trusted, instant feedback source exists at the moment of decision. Current alternatives — friends (biased), social media (slow/public), stylists (expensive) — all fail the core need for fast, honest, private feedback.

## The Solution

Snap a photo. Tell us the occasion. Get AI feedback in 30 seconds. Ask follow-up questions like a real friend.

Our AI speaks with a Vogue editorial voice — no hedging, no generic advice. It evaluates color harmony, proportions, fit, occasion-appropriateness, and offers specific quick fixes. Users can then ask follow-up questions ("What shoes would work better?") for a natural conversational experience.

## Product Status

**Fully built and deployment-ready.** 37 app screens, 16 backend API domains, 54+ database tables. Backend deployed on Railway. AI pipeline live with automated 7-stage training system. iOS + Android app store submissions in progress.

**What's built:** Camera capture, context input, AI feedback, follow-up conversation, outfit history, community feed, A/B comparisons, gamification, subscription management, privacy controls, complete brand identity.

## Growth Strategy

1. **Private beta** — 500 users from Reddit fashion communities + Instagram
2. **ProductHunt + TikTok** — Outfit content is one of the dominant categories on short-form video
3. **Organic flywheel** — "Or This?" A/B comparisons are inherently shareable; give-to-get system drives engagement

**Built-in virality:** Every outfit check is a potential share. The brand name is a conversation starter.

## Key Metrics Targets

| Timeframe | MAU | Daily Checks | D7 Retention | Helpfulness |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Month 6 | 50K | 10K | 30% | 4.0/5 |
| Month 12 | 250K | 75K | 40% | 4.2/5 |

## Competitive Advantage

No direct competitor owns the "moment of decision" for outfit feedback. Stitch Fix is subscription boxes (slow, expensive). Pinterest is inspiration (not feedback). ChatGPT is generic (not fashion-specialized). We are purpose-built for one thing: honest outfit feedback, instantly.

**Moat:** Proprietary AI training pipeline. Style DNA profiles that deepen over time. Community network effects. Every outfit analyzed makes the AI smarter.

## The Ask

**Raising $1.5M seed** to launch and scale to Series A metrics.

| 25% | Growth — creators, community, launch marketing |
