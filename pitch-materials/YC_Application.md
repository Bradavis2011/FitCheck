## Application Questions

### What does your company do?

Or This? gives women instant, honest outfit feedback at the exact moment they need it — standing in front of the mirror, about to leave the house. Snap a photo, tell us where you're going, get editorial-quality AI feedback in 30 seconds, then ask follow-up questions like you would with a trusted, stylish friend.

We own the **moment of decision**. Not inspiration. Not shopping. Not social media. The 30 seconds before you walk out the door.

But the consumer app is only half the story.

Every outfit check generates structured fashion intelligence — StyleDNA attributes, color harmonies, occasion patterns, garment frequencies, AI scores, and community signals. At scale, this becomes **the world's only real-time, bottom-up consumer fashion dataset**: what real people actually wear, to real occasions, scored by AI, validated by community consensus.

Or This? is a consumer app built on a fashion intelligence platform. The app drives subscriptions and engagement. The dataset drives the moat, the B2B revenue expansion, and the defensibility that makes this venture-scale.

Comparable: WGSN earns ~$100M+ ARR selling fashion intelligence built on runway predictions and surveys. Ours will be built on actual consumer behavior. It's a fundamentally better data source — and no competitor can replicate it without our user base.

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise?

I built this because I lived the problem — literally.

I was a signed model with Rae Agency and a SAG-AFTRA actor. Getting dressed for shoots, auditions, and appearances wasn't casual — it was high-stakes. I know what it costs to dress wrong for the wrong occasion, and how few reliable resources exist at the moment you need honest feedback. This isn't an intellectual exercise. I lived it.

That experience shaped how I understood the problem. My career gave me the tools to solve it.

I spent 8 years managing AI products at Apple (Project Manager, Health Technologies — digital health trials, Apple Watch health programs), Verily (Program Manager, Project Baseline — Alphabet's major health study, COVID-19 clinical trials), and Komodo Health (Program Manager — AI analytics GTM for 12 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies). $15M+ in product revenue. I understand how AI products work, how to manage them to quality, and how to take them to market at scale.

And I can build the technology myself. This entire product — 37 screens, 16 API domains, 54+ database models, 16 autonomous AI agents — is one person's work.

Vision AI crossed the quality threshold in 2023–24. Models can now reliably analyze a real outfit photo and give specific, useful, fashion-literate feedback. This category literally could not exist before. I recognized that window and built immediately.

### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to?

**Current substitutes all fail the core need:**

- **Friends/partners** — biased, unavailable, or "you look fine"
- **Social media** — too slow, too public, not actionable by the time responses arrive
- **Pinterest/fashion apps** — inspiration, not feedback on what you're wearing right now
- **Stylists** — $100–500/session, appointment-only, not available at 7:45am on a Tuesday
- **ChatGPT** — no fashion specialization, no occasion context, no editorial voice

**What's new:**

1. **Moment-of-decision focus.** We solve one problem — honest outfit feedback, right now, before you leave. That focus is our entire strategy.

2. **Editorial AI voice.** Our v3.0 prompt embeds real fashion expertise — color theory, proportions, occasion dress codes, silhouette rules — and delivers feedback with a decisive editorial voice. No hedging. No "it depends." Specific, honest, actionable.

3. **Context-aware analysis.** "Business casual for a tech startup" gets different feedback than "first date at a rooftop bar." Occasion, setting, weather, and vibe all factor in. The AI understands context most fashion AI ignores.

4. **Conversational follow-up.** Not a rating — a conversation. Users ask follow-up questions exactly like they would with a knowledgeable friend, and the AI remembers the full context of the outfit.

5. **Style DNA that compounds.** Every check builds a personalized style profile. The feedback gets sharper over time. The AI knows your color season, body type, and fashion goals. The product gets better the more you use it — and that data stays with us.

6. **A proprietary dataset, not just an app.** Most AI consumer apps generate engagement. We generate structured fashion intelligence. Every outfit check is a labeled data point: what was worn, to what occasion, scored by AI, rated by the user, and validated by community. At scale, this dataset becomes a B2B asset that competitors cannot replicate.

7. **AI-native operations.** 16 autonomous backend agents handle content creation, growth monitoring, user engagement, app store management, and weekly founder briefings. One person can run this at the scale of a 10-person team.

### How do or will you make money?

**Two revenue layers:**

**Layer 1 — Consumer subscriptions (freemium SaaS):**

| | Free | Plus ($4.99/mo) | Pro ($14.99/mo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI checks/day | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Follow-ups | 3/check | 5/check | 10/check |
| History | 7 days | Full | Full |
| Ads | Yes | No | No |
| Community feedback | — | Yes | Yes |
| Expert reviews | — | Add-on | 5 included/mo |
| Style analytics | — | — | Yes |

**Layer 2 — Fashion intelligence licensing (B2B):**

Every outfit check generates structured data. At scale, we license it to brands, retailers, and trend forecasters who need to know what real consumers actually wear — not what runways predict.

| Product | Price | Buyer |
|---|---|---|
| Trend Reports | $15–50K / quarter | Brands, retailers, forecasters |
| Custom Brand Research | $25–100K per study | "How do women 25–35 dress for work in 2026?" |
| Real-Time Trend API | $5–20K / month | Fast-fashion retailers |
| White-Label Styling SDK | $10–50K / month | Retailer apps wanting embedded AI feedback |

At Month 24, consumer subscriptions are the primary revenue. By Year 3, B2B data licensing is the highest-margin, fastest-growing stream — projected to grow to 25%+ of total revenue at scale.

**Unit economics:**
- AI cost per check: ~$0.003 (Gemini Vision API)
- Blended monthly cost per user: ~$0.50
- AI API costs dropping ~50% year-over-year — our margins improve automatically
- Target LTV:CAC: 10–30x with organic-first growth

---

### How far along are you?

**The product is fully built and deployment-ready.**

- **37 app screens** covering the complete user journey — onboarding, camera, context, AI feedback, follow-up conversation, history, community feed, A/B comparisons, live streaming, expert marketplace, challenges, wardrobe management, event planning, profile, referrals
- **16 active API domains** — auth, outfits, social, wardrobe, comparisons, notifications, subscriptions, trends, referrals, experts, challenges, events, analytics, admin, agents, and more
- **54+ database models** covering users, outfits, social graph, wardrobe, community, gamification, agent operations, analytics, referrals, and the full StyleDNA data schema
- **Backend deployed** on Railway with PostgreSQL
- **AI pipeline live** — Gemini Vision with automated quality pipeline, prompt v3.0 in production, Style DNA building on every check, self-calibration when helpfulness drops
- **Monetization implemented** — RevenueCat subscription management, Google AdMob, tier enforcement on all gated endpoints
- **16 autonomous AI agents** running backend operations: content calendar, growth dashboard, beta recruiter, viral loop monitor, AI quality monitor, revenue tracking, lifecycle emails, community management, social media drafts, app store review responses, outreach, and weekly founder brief
- **Fashion intelligence data schema** built — StyleDNA, occasion patterns, garment normalization, trend signals all structured and queryable

**What we haven't done yet:** Launched publicly. We're pre-users. The product is complete. Every day without users is a day we're not generating the dataset.

---

### How will you get users?

**Phase 1: Private beta (Months 1–2)**
- 500 users from Reddit fashion communities (r/femalefashionadvice: 2M+ members)
- Direct outreach through my modeling/acting network — people who care deeply about appearance and will give honest product feedback
- Goal: validate retention, helpfulness ratings, and the feedback quality ceiling

**Phase 2: Public launch (Months 3–4)**
- ProductHunt launch
- TikTok/Reels — outfit feedback is one of the platform's dominant content categories; our 30-second feedback loop is inherently short-form video content
- Micro-creator partnerships (10–50K followers, fashion/lifestyle niche)

**Phase 3: Organic flywheel (Months 4+)**
- "Or This?" A/B comparisons are designed to be shared — users post two outfit options, friends vote, friends download
- Give-to-get: free users earn bonus AI checks by giving community feedback
- Referral system (already built): bonus daily checks for each invite that converts
- Word of mouth: "Have you tried this app?" is the goal state

**Built-in virality:** Every outfit check is a potential share. The brand name is a conversation starter. Both are true simultaneously — that's rare.

---

### What is your long-term vision?

**Year 1:** Become the default "outfit check" app. The thing women open instinctively before anything that matters.

**Year 2–3:** Expand from feedback to full personal style intelligence.
- Style DNA that evolves continuously — colors, silhouettes, preferences, occasions
- Wardrobe management with AI-generated outfit combinations
- Shopping recommendations tied to real wardrobe gaps, not generic ads
- Video analysis for 360° outfit assessment

**Year 3–5: The platform play.**

The consumer app has been generating structured fashion intelligence since Day 1. By Year 3, we have enough depth and coverage to become a serious B2B data business:
- Fashion brands and retailers paying for real-time consumer trend data
- Trend forecasters replacing survey panels with our live behavioral dataset
- Fast-fashion operators using our API for daily trend signals
- Retailers embedding our styling SDK in their own apps

This is when Or This? stops being a consumer app with a data side business and becomes a fashion intelligence platform that also has a consumer app. The dataset compounds. The moat deepens. The B2B margins (80%+) are fundamentally different from subscription economics.

**The WGSN comparison is intentional.** WGSN generates ~$100M+ ARR selling fashion intelligence to the industry. Their data is built on runway predictions and editorial trend reports. Ours is built on what millions of real people actually choose to wear, to real occasions, scored by AI, rated by users, and validated by community. That's a fundamentally better signal — and we'll have it because we built the consumer product first.

**The ultimate vision:** Everyone has access to great personal style advice — not just people who can afford a stylist. And every brand, retailer, and trend forecaster has access to the most accurate real-time picture of what consumers actually wear.

### If you have already participated in an incubator or accelerator, which ones?

None.

---

### Why did you pick this group of founders?

I'm the right founder for this because I've lived on both sides of the problem.

As a former signed model (Rae Agency) and SAG-AFTRA actor, I spent years in an industry where your appearance is literally your professional product. I know what it costs to dress wrong. I know the anxiety of having no honest feedback source available when you need one. This is not founder-market fit on paper — I built this app because I needed it.

Then I spent 8 years at Apple, Verily (Alphabet), and Komodo Health managing AI products at scale. I led AI analytics GTM for 12 of the top 20 pharmaceutical companies. I managed digital health AI programs at Apple. I drove $15M+ in revenue across these organizations. I know how to build AI products that work, how to manage them to quality, and how to take them to market.

And I built the entire product myself. Every line of code — React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, the AI pipeline, the 16 agent system, the subscription infrastructure — is mine. That combination of lived domain expertise, AI product management experience, and technical build capacity is genuinely rare. Most founders in this space either understand fashion or understand AI. I understand both, at professional depth, from the inside of each.

---

### How do you know each other?

Solo founder. The product was built entirely by me.

---

### What is the biggest risk?

**AI feedback quality at launch.** If the feedback is generic, hedging, or wrong, users won't come back. The data platform story doesn't matter without retention.

**How we mitigate this:**

1. Our prompt (v3.0) was built specifically for fashion — not adapted from a general-purpose template. It embeds real fashion knowledge: color theory, proportions, occasion-specific dress codes, body balance principles.
2. We've built automated self-calibration: if helpfulness ratings drop below threshold, the AI adjusts its approach without a new app release.
3. Follow-up conversations let users steer the AI toward more specific advice — the system learns within a session.
4. Style DNA personalization means feedback improves with each check — the AI knows the user's specific context over time.
5. Community and expert layers provide human validation on top of AI, which also generates labeled training data.

We've also calibrated our quality bar realistically: the AI doesn't need to replace a professional stylist. It needs to be better than asking a distracted partner, posting on Reddit, or walking out in uncertainty. That's a bar we clear comfortably — and it's what users actually need.

---

### What would you work on if this idea fails?

The thesis I've validated is that vision AI can now give genuinely useful, domain-specific advice in personal, visual contexts — and that the data generated in doing so has compounding value.

If Or This? fails on execution, not thesis, I'd apply the same architecture elsewhere: interview prep (AI analyzing presentation and body language), real estate (AI giving instant property assessment at a showing), or medical second opinions — where I have 8 years of deep background from Apple and Verily. All of these have the same structural opportunity: a consumer use case that generates proprietary behavioral data with B2B value.

---

### What surprised you about working on this?

Two things.

**First, the emotional response.** Users don't just want to know if an outfit works — they want to feel confident before they leave. When the feedback is specific and honest, the reaction is visceral. "This is exactly what I've been looking for." That emotional resonance tells me this is a real problem with a real solution, not a nice-to-have.

**Second, how fast I could build it.** I expected 6+ months. Between AI coding assistants and my technical background, a full production-grade application — 37 screens, 54+ database models, 16 autonomous backend agents, deployed and operational — came together in weeks. That speed is a signal: the underlying thesis is correct, the tooling has matured, and the right founder can move at a pace that wasn't possible 2 years ago.

## YC-Specific

### Why do you want to do YC?

Three specific reasons:

**1. Consumer cold-start expertise.** YC has funded dozens of consumer apps that cracked the cold-start problem. I want direct access to the founders and partners who've solved exactly this — getting the first 10,000 users to care about something new. The playbook matters here.

**2. Fundraising acceleration.** This is pre-launch. The YC brand and demo day will compress a 6-month fundraise into 6 weeks. I'd rather spend the difference building and growing.

**3. The data platform thesis pressure-test.** The venture-scale story here is the fashion intelligence platform — the WGSN play built on consumer behavior data. YC partners have seen every wave of consumer AI and every attempt at a B2B data business. I want them to either validate that thesis or force me to sharpen it. That's a conversation worth having before we're 18 months in.

---

### How did you hear about YC?

Years of following the startup ecosystem. Paul Graham's essays shaped how I think about product and founder-market fit.

## Demo Day One-Liner

"Or This? gives women honest AI outfit feedback in 30 seconds — and every outfit analyzed generates structured fashion intelligence that, at scale, becomes the world's premier real-time consumer fashion dataset. We're building the WGSN of actual consumer behavior, not runway predictions. Founder is a former signed model who managed AI products at Apple and Verily. Raising $1.5M."

---

## 1-Minute Pitch Script

"Every day, millions of women stand in front of the mirror asking 'does this actually look good?' They have nobody honest and available to ask. Friends are biased. Partners say 'you look fine.' Social media is too slow and too public.

Or This? solves this in 30 seconds. Snap a photo, tell us where you're going, and our fashion-specialized AI gives you honest, specific feedback — what's working, what to reconsider, quick fixes you can make right now. Then ask follow-ups, exactly like you would with a stylish friend.

We own the moment of decision. Not inspiration. Not shopping. That moment, specifically, is ours.

But here's the bigger story: every outfit check generates structured fashion intelligence — StyleDNA, color harmonies, occasion patterns, trend signals. At scale, this is the world's only real-time, bottom-up consumer fashion dataset. Think WGSN — except instead of runway predictions and surveys, ours is built on what real people actually wear. WGSN earns over $100 million a year. We'll have fundamentally better data.

The product is fully built — 37 screens, live AI backend, 16 autonomous agents operating the business. I'm a former signed model who spent 8 years managing AI at Apple and Verily. I lived the problem. I built the solution. I'm raising $1.5M to go from built to beloved — and to start generating the dataset that makes this defensible."
