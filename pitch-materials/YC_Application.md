## Application Questions

### What does your company do?

Or This? gives women instant, honest outfit feedback powered by AI. You snap a photo, tell us where you're going, and in 30 seconds you get expert-quality analysis: what's working, what to reconsider, and quick fixes you can make before you walk out the door. Then you can ask follow-up questions like you would with a trusted friend — "What shoes would work better?" or "Is this too casual for a client dinner?"

We're the only product focused on the **moment of decision** — not inspiration, not shopping, not social media. Just private, fast, honest feedback when you need it most.

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise?

Every woman we've talked to has the same story: standing in front of the mirror, running late, unsure if the outfit works, with nobody honest and available to ask. It's a universal daily friction point that nobody has solved because the technology didn't exist until now.

Vision AI has crossed the quality threshold in the past 18 months. For the first time, models like Gemini can reliably analyze a real outfit photo and give specific, useful, fashion-literate feedback. This category literally could not exist before 2024.

[Add personal domain expertise here — fashion industry background, consumer product experience, AI/ML expertise, etc.]

### What's new about what you're making? What substitutes do people resort to?

**Current substitutes all fail the core need:**

- **Friends/partners** — Biased ("you look great!"), unavailable when you need them, or give non-answers ("you look fine")
- **Social media** — Too slow (by the time you get responses, you've already left), too public, not actionable
- **Pinterest/fashion apps** — Inspiration, not feedback on what you're actually wearing right now
- **Stylists** — $100-500/session, require appointments, not available at 7:45am on a Tuesday
- **ChatGPT** — No fashion specialization, generic responses, no understanding of occasion context

**What's new:**
1. **Specialized AI prompt engineering** — Our v3.0 prompt embeds fashion expertise (color theory, proportions, occasion dress codes) and speaks in a decisive Vogue editorial voice. No hedging, no generic advice.
2. **Context-aware** — We factor in occasion, setting, weather, vibe, and specific concerns. "Business casual for a tech startup" gets very different feedback than "first date at a rooftop bar."
3. **Conversational follow-up** — Users don't just get a rating. They can have a back-and-forth conversation about their outfit, exactly like asking a knowledgeable friend.
4. **Automated AI quality pipeline** — A 7-stage system that continuously tests and improves our AI's fashion expertise.

### How do or will you make money?

**Freemium SaaS with three tiers:**

| | Free | Plus ($4.99/mo) | Pro ($14.99/mo) |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI checks/day | 3 | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| Follow-ups | 3/check | 5/check | 10/check |

- Affiliate shopping links (when AI recommends specific items)
- Brand partnerships (sponsored styling tips)
- Google AdMob ads on free tier

**Unit economics:**
- AI cost per check: ~$0.003 (Gemini Vision API)
- Blended monthly cost per user: ~$0.50
- API costs dropping ~50% year-over-year
- Target LTV:CAC of 10-30x with organic-first growth

### How far along are you?

**The product is fully built and deployment-ready:**

- **37 app screens** covering the complete user journey (onboarding → camera → context → AI feedback → follow-up → history → community)
- **16 backend API domains** (auth, outfits, social, live streaming, wardrobe, events, challenges, expert reviews, etc.)
- **54+ database tables** with comprehensive data model
- **Backend deployed** on Railway with PostgreSQL
- **AI pipeline live** — Gemini Vision integration with automated 7-stage training pipeline, prompt v3.0 in production
- **Monetization implemented** — RevenueCat subscription management, Google AdMob, tier enforcement on all endpoints
- **App store submissions** in progress for iOS and Android

We've built through 9 development phases covering core AI feedback, community features, live streaming, expert marketplace, challenges, wardrobe management, event planning, privacy controls, and brand identity.

**What we haven't done yet:** Launched publicly. We're pre-users. The product is complete but hasn't been put in front of a real audience at scale.

### How will you get users?

**Phase 1: Private beta (Months 1-2)**
- Seed 500 users from Reddit communities (r/femalefashionadvice has 2M+ members)
- Instagram fashion micro-communities
- Direct outreach to fashion-adjacent influencers
- Goal: Validate retention and feedback quality

**Phase 2: Public launch (Months 3-4)**
- ProductHunt launch
- TikTok/Reels content — outfit feedback content is one of the platform's dominant categories
- Micro-creator partnerships (10-50K followers, fashion/lifestyle niche)

**Phase 3: Organic flywheel (Months 4+)**
- "Or This?" A/B comparisons are inherently shareable — users post two outfits and ask friends to vote
- Give-to-get system: free users earn bonus AI checks by giving community feedback, driving engagement loops
- Word of mouth: "Have you tried this app?" is the goal state

**Built-in virality:** Every outfit check is a potential sharing moment. The brand name itself ("Or This?") is a conversation starter.

### What is your long-term vision?

**Year 1:** Become the default "outfit check" app — the thing women open instinctively when getting dressed for anything important.

**Year 2-3:** Expand from feedback to full personal style intelligence:
- Style DNA that evolves with the user (colors, silhouettes, preferences)
- Wardrobe management with AI-suggested outfit combinations
- Shopping recommendations based on wardrobe gaps
- Video analysis for 360-degree outfit assessment

**Year 5+:** The personal style AI platform:
- AI that knows your style better than you do
- Integration with e-commerce (try-before-you-buy with AI pre-screening)
- Enterprise B2B (retailer AI styling tools, virtual fitting rooms)
- The world's largest dataset of real outfit-to-feedback pairs — a unique AI training moat

**The ultimate vision:** Everyone has access to great personal style advice, not just people who can afford a stylist.

### If you have already participated in an incubator or accelerator, which ones?

[None / List any previous programs]

### Why did you pick this group of founders?

[Describe why this team is uniquely suited to build this product. Address:]
- Technical capability to build AI + consumer mobile products
- Understanding of the target user and their pain points
- Relevant industry or domain connections
- Complementary skill sets
- Passion for the problem

### How do you know each other?

[Describe founder relationship]

### What is the biggest risk?

**AI feedback quality at launch.** If the AI gives generic, unhelpful, or inaccurate outfit feedback, users won't come back.

**How we mitigate this:**
1. Our prompt engineering (v3.0) has been specifically optimized for fashion — not general-purpose AI chat
2. We've built a 7-stage automated training pipeline that continuously tests and improves quality
3. Follow-up conversations let users guide the AI to more specific advice
4. We can rapidly iterate on the prompt without app updates (server-side)
5. Community and expert layers provide human validation on top of AI

We've also designed the product so the AI doesn't need to be perfect — it needs to be better than the alternatives (asking no one, asking a distracted partner, posting on social media). That's a lower bar than "replacing a professional stylist."

### What would you work on if this idea fails?

[Answer honestly — what other problem would you apply your skills to?]

### What surprised you about working on this?

[Share a genuine insight from building the product, e.g.:]
- How strong the emotional response is — women don't just want to know if an outfit works, they want to feel confident before they leave the house
- How much occasion context matters — the same outfit scores very differently for "coffee with friends" vs. "job interview"
- How rapidly AI vision quality is improving — features we thought were 2 years away became possible in months

## 1-Minute Pitch Script

"Every day, millions of women stand in front of the mirror asking 'does this look good?' They have nobody honest and available to ask. Friends are biased. Partners say 'you look fine.' Social media is too slow and too public.

Or This? solves this in 30 seconds. Snap a photo, tell us where you're going, and our AI — trained with real fashion expertise — gives you honest, specific feedback: what's working, what to reconsider, and quick fixes you can make right now. Then ask follow-ups, just like talking to a stylish friend.

We're not an inspiration app. We're not a shopping app. We own the moment of decision — the 30 seconds before you walk out the door.

The product is fully built: 37 screens, live AI backend, ready for app stores. We're raising $1.5M seed to launch, build our community flywheel, and become the default outfit check for every woman who cares about how she looks but doesn't have a stylist on speed dial.

Vision AI crossed the quality threshold 18 months ago. This category could not have existed before. We're here first, and every outfit we analyze makes our AI smarter. That's our moat."
