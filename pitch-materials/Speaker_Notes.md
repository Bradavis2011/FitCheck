# Or This? — Pitch Deck Speaker Notes

Use these notes when presenting the deck. Each section corresponds to a slide. For YC interviews, aim for the full deck in under 3 minutes. For investor meetings, expand to 8-10 minutes.

---

## Slide 1: Title

> "Or This? is an AI-powered outfit feedback app. We give women honest, instant feedback on what they're wearing — in 30 seconds, right before they walk out the door."

*Don't linger here. Move to the problem immediately.*

---

## Slide 2: The Problem

> "Every morning, millions of women stand in front of the mirror and ask 'does this actually look good?' Outfit indecision is one of the most universally reported daily stressors for women — and the options are terrible.
>
> Your friends are biased. Your partner says 'you look fine.' Social media is too slow and too public. Pinterest gives inspiration but not feedback on what you're actually wearing. A stylist costs hundreds of dollars — and they're not available at 7:45am on a Tuesday.
>
> There is no honest, available, instant feedback source at the moment of decision. That moment — standing in front of the mirror, running late — is where we live."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution

> "Or This? is dead simple. Four steps: snap a full-body photo, tell us where you're going, get AI feedback in 30 seconds, then ask follow-ups like you would a friend.
>
> We're not an inspiration app. Not a shopping app. Not social media. Just honest, instant, private outfit feedback. That focus is our entire strategy."

---

## Slide 4: The AI

> "Under the hood, we've built a fashion-specialized AI — think Vogue editor in your pocket. It's trained with real fashion expertise: color theory, proportions, occasion dress codes, seasonal trends.
>
> You get a score, specific praise, honest critique, and quick fixes. But the magic is the follow-up. You can ask 'What shoes would work better?' or 'Is this too casual for a client dinner?' It's a real conversation, not just a rating.
>
> We've built an automated 7-stage training pipeline that continuously improves the AI's quality. Every outfit we analyze makes it smarter."

---

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity

> "$1.8 trillion global apparel market. $5.5 billion in online personal styling services — growing 15% annually to $15 billion by 2032. We're targeting $200 million in ARR by Year 5 — 2 million paying subscribers plus B2B fashion intelligence licensing. For context, Duolingo has 8 million paid subscribers. We need 2 million.
>
> But the bigger story is the data. Every outfit we analyze generates structured fashion intelligence — what real people actually wear to real occasions, scored by AI, validated by community consensus. At scale, we become the premier real-time fashion data source for the industry. Think WGSN, but built on actual consumer behavior instead of runway predictions."

---

## Slide 6: Business Model

> "Freemium with three tiers. Free users get 3 AI checks per day with ads. Plus at $4.99 unlocks unlimited checks and community features. Pro at $14.99 adds expert stylist reviews and style analytics.
>
> The free tier is generous enough to hook users. The limits create natural upgrade moments — 'I want more checks' or 'I want to ask the community.' Plus is the sweet spot for most users."

---

## Slide 7: Unit Economics

> "Here's why this business works: our cost per AI check is about $0.003 — three tenths of a cent. Blended monthly cost per user is about fifty cents.
>
> And here's the kicker: AI API costs have dropped 90% in the past 18 months and keep falling. Our COGS improves automatically every quarter — the opposite of most consumer businesses. Our margins get better over time without us doing anything."

---

## Slide 8: Growth Flywheel

> "The product has built-in virality. The A/B comparison feature — 'Or This?' — is inherently shareable. Users post two outfit options and ask friends to vote. Friends download to participate. They try the AI. They get hooked.
>
> For launch, we're seeding through Reddit fashion communities — 2 million members on r/femalefashionadvice alone — TikTok creator partnerships, and a ProductHunt launch. Outfit content is one of the dominant categories on short-form video.
>
> Long-term, we're building a give-to-get flywheel: free users earn bonus checks by giving community feedback, which creates the engagement loop that drives the community."

---

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

> "Nobody owns the moment of decision. Stitch Fix sends you a box in the mail — that's days, not seconds. Pinterest gives inspiration, not feedback. ChatGPT is generic — it has no fashion specialization.
>
> We're purpose-built for one thing, and we do it better than anything else that exists.
>
> Our moat deepens over time: a proprietary AI training pipeline, Style DNA profiles that learn user preferences, and community network effects. The more people use it, the better it gets."

---

## Slide 10: Traction & Status

> "The product is fully built. 29 screens covering the complete user journey. 14 active API domains. 41 database models. Backend deployed and operational. AI pipeline live with our v2.0 prompt and Style DNA personalization in production.
>
> We're submitting to app stores now. We haven't launched publicly yet — we're pre-users — but the product is real, it works, and it's ready for people.
>
> Our 6-month targets: 50K monthly active users, 10K daily outfit checks, 30% day-7 retention, and a 4.0 out of 5 helpfulness rating."

---

## Slide 11: Roadmap

> "Our roadmap is about discipline. Right now: launch, nail the core loop, get to 500 beta users. Q3: turn on community features and the give-to-get flywheel. Q4: activate monetization and the expert marketplace. 2027: scale — video analysis, shopping integration, international.
>
> We're resisting the temptation to do everything at once. The core AI feedback loop has to be undeniably great before we layer anything on top."

---

## Slide 12: The Team

> "I'm the right founder for this because I've lived on both sides of the problem.
>
> I was a signed model with Rae Agency and a SAG actor. I spent years in an industry where your appearance is literally your professional product. I know what it costs to dress wrong, and how few reliable resources exist for fast, honest feedback.
>
> Then I spent 8 years at Apple, Verily — that's Alphabet — and Komodo Health managing AI products. I led AI analytics GTM for 12 of the top 20 pharma companies. I have a Kellogg MBA from Northwestern.
>
> And I built every line of code in this product myself. That's unusual — but I'm a technical founder. React Native, TypeScript, PostgreSQL — all of it.
>
> The combination of living the problem, managing AI at scale, and being able to build the solution is genuinely rare. That's why I'm here."

---

## Slide 13: The Ask

> "We're raising $1.5 million seed. 40% goes to engineering — scaling infrastructure and hiring two engineers. 25% to growth — creator partnerships and launch marketing. 20% to AI and data. 15% to operations.
>
> With this raise, our 18-month milestones are: 250K monthly active users, 75K daily checks, and Series A metrics — over $1 million in ARR with proven unit economics."

---

## Slide 14: Closing

> "Or This? Confidence in every choice. We'd love to have you join us."

## YC Interview Tips

**For the 10-minute YC interview:**
- Lead with the problem (30 seconds)
- Demo the product live if possible (60 seconds)
- Explain why now / why you (60 seconds)
- Let them drive the rest with questions

**Common YC questions to prepare for:**
1. "What do you understand that others don't?"
2. "Who are your first 100 users and how do you get them?"
3. "What's your biggest concern about this business?"
4. "How does this become a billion-dollar company?"
5. "If we fund you, what do you do in the first 2 weeks?"
6. "What have users told you that surprised you?"
7. "Why hasn't someone done this already?" (Answer: vision AI quality threshold crossed recently)
8. "How do you handle the cold start / chicken-and-egg problem?" (Answer: AI solves it — no community needed to start)

**Key talking points to hit:**
- "Could not have existed 18 months ago" — timing narrative
- "30 seconds" — speed is the differentiator
- "Moment of decision" — we own a specific moment no one else targets
- "Margins improve automatically" — AI cost deflation story
- "Built, not pitched" — the product is real and complete
